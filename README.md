## 🧘 What Is It?

**Breathing Ball** is a minimalist GNOME Shell extension designed to help you relax with a calm and steady breathing rhythm.  
It temporarily clears your workspace by lowering all open windows, showing a peaceful breathing animation:  
a simple ball moving up and down in a tube, guiding slow, deep breaths.

The goal: **reduce stress, promote relaxation, and provide a soothing moment of calm** right from your desktop.
